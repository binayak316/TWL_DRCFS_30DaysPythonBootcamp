This is the documentation of the hamro_patro_rasifal_scrape.py file 


The flow of the program:

1. first of all import the requests and BeautifulSoup module because this file makes a requests and get response back
2. make a variable called response which will store the response from that url
3. page is a variable in which response will be stored in text format
4. and soup is the variable after the parsing (html.parse)
5. Now find the division in that webpage of class "desc" by using find_all() builtin functions
6. and store that soup to the rasifal variable
7. make a empty list which is rasi_list )
8. if we use find_all() method for finding the division of name "desc" then we can't use getText() we have use getText() in for loop so
9. make a forloop for rasifal variable to get text of that division
10. append that text to that empty list which is rasi_list(declared at the top)
11. after that work with the text file 
12. open the hamropatro.txt file with write mode(open() method automatically creates the txt file  and writes)
13. make a forloop and write the rasifal as a text
